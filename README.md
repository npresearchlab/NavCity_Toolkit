# About

The NavCity Toolkit is a suite of spatial navigation tasks that contains a naturalistic, city-like, wayfinding navigation task in virtual reality (_'NavCity'_), as well as a _NavCity_ Allocentric Representation Assessment ('NARA'), a pen-and-paper assessment of formed allocentric representations administered after _NavCity_ exposure. This toolkit contains all open-source code, files, and materials utilized in both of these tasks, with the aim of providing an easily accessible, open-source, virtual reality navigation tool to the wider scientific research community.
